I'm a researcher at Arm Ltd. My primary focus is on the security of constrained embedded systems.
I also am involved in several open source projects: [pyOCD](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD) and
[DAPLink](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink).

The opinions and thoughts expressed on this site are mine alone and do not necessarily represent the views of my current employer or past employers.
